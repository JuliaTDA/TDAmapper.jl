## What is a mapper algorithm?

We can boil down the two mapper algorithms we saw as follows:

1) Given a metric space $(X, d)$, create a covering $C$ of $X$;
1) Using $C$ as vertex, create a graph.

In the classical mapper context, $C$ is generated using the clustering of pre-images of a function $f: X \to \mathbb{R}$. In the ball mapper scenario, we cover $X$ using $\epsilon$-balls with centers as a subset of $X$.

Here's how we can generalize the mapper algorithm:

1) Create the covering in some different ways
1) Choose a graph-from-covering algorithm different from the traditional nerve complex.
