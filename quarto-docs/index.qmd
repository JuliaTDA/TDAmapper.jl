## Installation

In Julia, type 

```
] add https://github.com/JuliaTDA/TDAmapper.jl https://github.com/JuliaTDA/GeometricDatasets.jl
```

The `]` character mark the command to be executed in Julia package mode.

## First usage

Load the packages

```{julia}
using TDAmapper;
import GeometricDatasets as gd;
```

create a torus

```{julia}
X = gd.torus(2000)
```

define the filter values

```{julia}
fv = X[1, :];
```

and the covering

```{julia}
C = uniform(fv, overlap = 150);
```

Calculate the mapper

```{julia}
#| output: false
mp = mapper(X, fv, C; clustering = cluster_dbscan(;radius = 1))
```

and plot the results

```{julia}
node_values = node_colors(mp, fv)

mapper_plot(mp, node_values = node_values)
```

## New to Julia?

That was too much Julia for you? No problem! You can learn more with some very nice books like these:
