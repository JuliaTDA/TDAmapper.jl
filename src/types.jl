# Mapper superclass
"""
    AbstractMapper

Abstract base type for all mapper implementations.

Mapper objects represent the result of applying a mapper algorithm to a metric space, containing the original space, covering, and resulting graph structure.

# Common Fields
All mapper implementations typically contain:
- `X::MetricSpace`: The original metric space
- `g::Graph`: The resulting mapper graph
- Additional fields specific to the mapper variant

# Subtypes
- [`Mapper`](@ref): Generalized mapper implementation
"""
abstract type AbstractMapper end

"""
    Mapper <: AbstractMapper

Represents the result of a classical or generic mapper algorithm.

# Fields
- `X::MetricSpace`: The original metric space that was analyzed
- `C::Covering`: The final covering after refinement (as index vectors)
- `g::Graph`: The mapper graph representing the nerve of the covering

# Description
The `Mapper` struct is used by the `mapper` function to represent the result of mapper algorithms that combine different covering, refinement, and nerve strategies.

# Example
```julia
using TDAmapper
# mapper_result = generic_mapper(X, custom_cover, custom_refiner, custom_nerve)
# println(mapper_result)  # Output: "Mapper graph with N vertices and M edges"
```

- [`BallMapper`](@ref): BallMapper implementation

    Base.convert(::Type{T}, x::Vector{<:Vector{<:Any}}) where {T <: Covering}

Convert a vector of vectors to a `Covering` type.

This method ensures all inner vectors are converted to contain `Int32` elements, suitable for use as a covering.

Identity conversion for `Covering` types.

    Base.show(io::IO, M::AbstractMapper)

Display a concise summary of a mapper object.

# Arguments
- `io::IO`: The output stream
- `M::AbstractMapper`: The mapper object to display

# Description
Prints a brief summary including the number of vertices and edges in the mapper graph, providing a quick overview of the graph's complexity.

# Example
```julia
# Output: "Mapper graph with 15 vertices and 23 edges"
