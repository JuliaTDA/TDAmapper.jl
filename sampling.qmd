## ϵ-net

An ϵ-net is a subset of a point cloud X such that 
$$
\forall x \in X, \exists y \in Y | d(x, y) <= \epsilon
$$

that is: every point $x$ of $X$ is in an ϵ-neighborhood of some point of $Y$.

### Example

```{julia}
using TDAmapper
using Plots

X = rand(2, 10^4)
ϵ = 0.1
ids = epsilon_net(X, ϵ)
Y = X[:, ids]
scatter(X[1, :], X[2, :])
scatter!(Y[1, :], Y[2, :], color = :red)
```
